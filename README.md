*read the code that makes a Hunter*

It is amazing to think that a file, about 15mb in size is what differentiates me from common shared genetic code. Certainly what is a result of millions of years of progress can be transferred to your computer in a matter of seconds. Probably at some point in the future bad things could happen because of this. But it's worth it for this one simple line:

```git clone https://github.com/huntersgordon/dna```

Inside is a text version of my DNA. Fields are TAB-separated. Each line corresponds to a single SNP.
